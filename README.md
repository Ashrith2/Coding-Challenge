    storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
    messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
    appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
```
## Running the Project

### Prerequisites
- Install the necessary dependencies for Firebase and DateTimePicker:
  
  `npm install firebase react-native-modal-datetime-picker`

## Firestore Index Setup

If you encounter an error related to Firestore indexes, follow these steps to create the necessary index:

1. **Go to Firestore Indexes Page:**
   Open the Firebase console and navigate to your Firestore database. Select the "Indexes" tab.

2. **Start Creating a New Index:**
   Click on the "Create Index" button.

3. **Define the Composite Index:**
   Create an index with the following fields:
   
   - **Collection ID**: `tasks`
   - **Fields**:
     - `dueDate`: Ascending
     - `userId`: Ascending

4. **Save the Index:**
   Click on "Create" to save the index. Firestore will take some time to build the index. Once it is ready, your queries should work without the indexing error.

### Example Index Creation

Hereâ€™s how you might set up the index if the collection is `tasks` and the fields are `dueDate` and `userId`:

- **Collection ID**: `tasks`
- **Field**: `dueDate` (Ascending)
- **Field**: `userId` (Ascending)

Once the index is created, the error should be resolved, and your Firestore queries should work as expected.

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
